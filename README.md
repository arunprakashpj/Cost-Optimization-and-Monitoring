- Estimate Azure infrastructure costs using the Azure Pricing Calculator.  
- Explain cost differences between on-prem and Azure Cloud for specific scenarios.  
- Highlight how resilience improves by transitioning from on-prem to Azure Cloud.  

### Section-2:-Monitoring-Cost-Efficiency  
- Explain the purpose of **Azure Policy**.  
- Demonstrate and explain how costs are displayed in Azure.  
- Outline the role of **Azure Cost Management + Billing Dashboard**.  
- Leverage Azure Policy to demonstrate cost savings and optimization.  

### Section-3:-Monitoring-Optional-Efficiency  
- Demonstrate the creation of a **Log Analytics Workspace**.  
- Showcase the setup of **Alerts and Actions** for cost monitoring.  
- Create and customize an **Azure Dashboard**.  
- Create and utilize **Azure Insights**.  
- Explain the purpose of **Azure Dashboards, Azure Monitor, and Alerts**.  
- Create an alert for a metric using **Azure Monitor**.  

### Section-4:-Automation  
- Demonstrate the creation of **Autoscale Rules** within Azure Monitor.  
- Explain the purpose of Azure Monitor's Autoscale functionality.
